##  Introduce
Inspired by TransMVSNet, this paper proposes a 3D reconstruction algorithm based on feature enhancement and weight optimization MVSNet (FEWO-MVSNet). Our method first extracts global and local feature information from multi-view images using an adaptive feature enhancement module, and then introduces an adaptive optimization mechanism for weight assignment to estimate fine depth maps of scenes with weak/repeated textures, and finally completes the reconstruction of high-density 3D point clouds.
